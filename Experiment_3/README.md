## AIM: 
To understand the basic structure of a PL/SQL program by creating and executing a simple PL/SQL block that includes declaration and execution sections, and to display output using built-in procedures.

## Software Requirements
- Database Management System:
    - PostgreSQL
- Database Administration Tool:
    - pgAdmin

## Objective:
- To create a simple PL/SQL program demonstrating Declaration Section and Execution Section.

## Problem Statement:
Design and implement a simple PL/SQL program that demonstrates the basic structure of a PL/SQL block. The program should include a declaration section to define variables and an execution section to perform operations using those variables and display the results using appropriate output statements.

1. Declaration Section (DECLARE)
    - Variables are declared and initialized:
        - emp_id → Employee ID
        - emp_name → Employee Name
        - emp_salary → Employee Salary
2. Execution Section (BEGIN ... END)
    - DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE is used to display output.
